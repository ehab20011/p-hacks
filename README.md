# RefuConnect

## Project Goal 
As of May 26th 2024, New York City alone had over 65,600 people seeking asylum in encampments & shelters. Over 200,000 as well since just 2022. 

In the US during the 43 years of the modern resettlement program, an average of 73,300 refugees have entered the US every year. 
That's over 3.1 Million Refugees! 

This influx of immigration, especially over the past 2-3 years has led to an overflow & collapse of our immigration system. 

Keeping the information about these refugees is not only an issue of its own but keeping contstant contact with them when they need help is especially difficult. 

Can you imagine coming to a country you have no idea about, being put in a shelter or encampment where you can only rely on the others to help you?

At **RefuConnect** our goal is to help refugees/asylum seekers connect & stay connected with their aids at the encampements they're staying in. 

Refugees will be able to sign up through the web app, select the encampment they're in & have direct connection to any aids & security available. This will allow for a streamlined access point for all aids to give help wherever they can & help those who need it most. 

This will also allow for any quick connection to security so if anything gets out of hand, they can find a security guard available quickly.
