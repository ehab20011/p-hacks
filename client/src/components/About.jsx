      <h4>
        As of May 26th 2024, New York City alone had over 65,600 people seeking
        asylum in encampments & shelters. Over 200,000 as well since just 2022.
      </h4>
      <h4>
        Can you imagine coming to a country you have no idea about, being put in
        a shelter or encampment where you can only rely on the others to help
        you?
      </h4>
      <h4>
        At RefuConnect our goal is to help refugees/asylum seekers connect &
        stay connected with their aids at the encampements they're staying in.
